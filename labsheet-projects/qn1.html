<!--Write a basic Html ‘hello world’ program with brief introduction of HTML5 and its basic tags. -->

<!-- ANSWER -->
<!-- 
HTML5 is the latest and most popular version of HyperText Markup Language. It defines the structure and content of web pages.  Here's a breakdown of creating a simple "Hello World" program using HTML5 and some basic tags:

1. Structure:

An HTML5 document has a basic structure with two main parts:

DOCTYPE declaration: This line specifies the document type as HTML5.
HTML element: This is the root element of the document and contains two child elements:
Head: Stores meta information about the document (title, character encoding, etc.).
Body: Contains the visible content of the web page. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>hello world</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
